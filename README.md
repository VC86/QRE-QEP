# Quantised Random Embeddings and the Quantized Eclipse Problem: Numerical Experiments

## Disclaimer
This repository illustrates some aspects of the dimensionality reduction addressed in [1], [2], [3] when applied to practical supervised learning problems, and as compared to the simplest case of adaptive dimensionality reduction, *i.e.*, principal component analysis (PCA).
